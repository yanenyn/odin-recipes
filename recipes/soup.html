            4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes
        </li>
        <li>
            1 slice onion
        </li>
        <li>
            4 cloves garlic
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cups chicken broth
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons butter
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon salt
        </li>

        Directions
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, large slice of onion, garlic cloves, and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, and gently boil for about 20 minutes to blend all of the flavors. Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.        </li>
        <li>
            In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a roux, cooking until the roux is a medium brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, so that no lumps form, then stir in the rest. Season with sugar and salt, and adjust to taste.
