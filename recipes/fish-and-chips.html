            1 cup milk
        </li>
        <li>
            1 egg
        </li>
        <li>
            1 quart vegetable oil for frying

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Directions
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place sliced potatoes in a medium bowl and cover with cold water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a separate medium bowl. Add milk and egg; stir until batter is smooth. Let stand for 20 minutes.        
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pot or electric skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).        
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain and pat dry potatoes. Fry in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes; drain on paper towels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dredge cod in batter, one piece at a time, and place in hot oil. Fry fish in batches until golden brown on all sides; drain on paper towels. Monitor oil temperature, increasing the heat as needed to maintain 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).        
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry potatoes again in hot oil until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes; drain on paper towels.
        </li>
    </ol>
