        <li>
            1 pound ground beef

        Directions
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
